**Researched:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

Professional liability (malpractice) insurance is essential for private practice. Psychiatric/mental health NPs are considered moderate risk.

## Estimated Costs

| Provider | Coverage | Annual Cost | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| CM&F Group | $1M/$3M | ~$1,421 | N2 class (Psych/MH) |
| Doctors Agency | $1M/$3M | $840-$1,538 | Psychiatric specialty |
| NSO (via HPSO) | $1M/$6M | ~$1,000-1,500 | Popular with NPs |
| Berxi | $1M/$3M | ~$1,000 | Lower cost option |

**Recommended coverage:** $1M per occurrence / $6M aggregate (or at minimum $1M/$3M)

## Policy Types

### Occurrence Policy ✅ Recommended
- Covers incidents that **occur** during policy period
- Coverage continues even after policy ends
- More expensive but better protection
- **No tail coverage needed**

### Claims-Made Policy
- Covers claims **filed** during policy period
- Requires "tail coverage" if you switch/cancel
- Less expensive initially
- Tail coverage can cost 1.5-2x annual premium

## Key Considerations

### For Multi-State Practice
- Most policies cover practice in multiple states
- Verify policy covers both Utah AND Massachusetts
- Some require notification of additional practice locations

### What's Typically Covered
- Defense costs
- Settlements/judgments
- License defense
- HIPAA violations (some policies)
- Sexual misconduct defense (limited)

### What to Ask Providers
1. Does this cover telehealth across state lines?
2. Is coverage occurrence or claims-made?
3. What's the tail coverage cost if claims-made?
4. Are both Utah and MA covered?
5. What's the process for adding a business entity as named insured?
