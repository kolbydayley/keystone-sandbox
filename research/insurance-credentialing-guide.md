# Insurance Panel Credentialing Guide

**Researched:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

If accepting insurance (vs cash-pay only), Paige needs to credential with insurance panels. This is a lengthy process — start early.

## Timeline

| Stage | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| CAQH Profile Setup | 1-2 weeks |
| Payer Applications | 2-4 weeks to submit |
| Payer Processing | 60-120 days per payer |
| **Total** | **3-6 months** |

⚠️ **Start credentialing ASAP** — can't bill insurance until approved.

## Step 1: CAQH Profile

**CAQH** (Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare) is a universal credentialing database.

1. Register at [proview.caqh.org](https://proview.caqh.org)
2. Complete profile with:
   - Education/training verification
   - License information (all states)
   - DEA registration
   - Malpractice insurance
   - Work history (10 years)
   - References
3. Attest (digitally sign) profile
4. Re-attest every 120 days to keep active

## Step 2: Apply to Insurance Panels

### Common Panels for Psychiatric NP

| Payer | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Blue Cross Blue Shield | Often easiest to start |
| Aetna | Good reimbursement |
| Cigna | Common employer plans |
| United Healthcare | Large network |
| Medicare | Requires separate enrollment |
| Medicaid | State-specific (UT + MA) |

### Application Process
1. Find provider enrollment portal for each payer
2. Submit application (references CAQH)
3. Wait for processing (60-120 days)
4. Receive contract and fee schedule
5. Sign and return
6. Get effective date

## Step 3: Medicare Enrollment

Separate process via **PECOS** (Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System)

1. Register at [pecos.cms.hhs.gov](https://pecos.cms.hhs.gov)
2. Complete CMS-855I application
3. Wait 60-90 days
4. Receive Medicare PTAN (Provider Transaction Access Number)

## Cash-Pay Alternative

**Consider:** Some psychiatric practices do cash-pay only

**Pros:**
- No credentialing wait
- No billing complexity
- Higher per-visit reimbursement
- No insurance denials

**Cons:**
- Limits patient population
- Patients may not afford
- Can offer superbills for out-of-network reimbursement

## Decision: Insurance vs Cash-Pay

| Factor | Insurance | Cash-Pay |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Patient access | Broader | Limited |
| Revenue per visit | Lower ($100-150) | Higher ($150-300) |
| Admin burden | High | Low |
| Startup delay | 3-6 months | Immediate |
| Billing complexity | High | None |

## Recommendation

**Hybrid approach:**
1. Start as cash-pay to see patients immediately
2. Credential with 2-3 major insurers in background
3. Add insurance patients once credentialed

## Next Steps

- [ ] Decision: Insurance, cash-pay, or hybrid?
- [ ] If insurance: Create CAQH profile
- [ ] If insurance: Identify top 3-5 payers to target
- [ ] If cash-pay: Set pricing structure
- [ ] If hybrid: Start cash-pay, submit credentialing apps in parallel
