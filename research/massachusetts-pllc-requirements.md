## Recommendation

✅ **Form a MA PLLC** — Higher cost but provides liability protection. MA's full practice authority is good for private practice autonomy.

## Note

Verify with Paige:
- Current MA NP license status
- Any transitional collaborative requirements
- Board of Registration in Nursing requirements for PLLC
