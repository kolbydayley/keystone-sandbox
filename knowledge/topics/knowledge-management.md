Methods and systems for capturing, organizing, and building knowledge.

## Key Insights
- [[t8k2m4p1]] Atomic notes = one idea per note; enables linking and reuse
- [[r3n7v5x2]] Storage vs building require different approaches; atomicity matters for building

## Frameworks
- **Zettelkasten**: Atomic, linked notes for knowledge building
- **PARA**: Projects/Areas/Resources/Archives for storage and actionability
- **Evergreen Notes**: Andy Matuschak's variant emphasizing concept-oriented, densely linked notes

## Open Questions
- How to handle temporal knowledge (things that expire or change)?
- Optimal atom size for different domains?
- When to promote atoms to larger documents?
