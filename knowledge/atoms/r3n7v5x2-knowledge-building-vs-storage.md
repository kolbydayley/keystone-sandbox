Knowledge building and knowledge storage serve different purposes and need different approaches.

**Storage** solves: access, organization, retrieval of existing material (PDFs, excerpts, references). Systems like PARA optimize for this — delay processing, organize for actionability, minimize upfront effort.

**Building** solves: creating new insights by connecting ideas. Requires atomic notes because links need well-scoped components. The investment in processing pays off through compounding connections.

Most systems conflate these. Pick your primary goal. For storage-heavy work, skip atomicity. For knowledge-building work, atomicity is essential.
