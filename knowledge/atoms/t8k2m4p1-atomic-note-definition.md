An atomic note captures exactly one idea — "the shortest writing session that could possibly be useful." The constraint forces clarity: if you need "and" to describe what a note contains, it should be two notes.

Atomicity matters most when building knowledge through links. Links imply components to connect; atomic scope ensures each component is a coherent, reusable unit. Without atomicity, notes become tangled — hard to link, hard to find, hard to combine.

The goal isn't small notes for their own sake. It's notes scoped so they can participate in many different contexts without dragging irrelevant content along.
